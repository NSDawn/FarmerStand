### FarmerStand ###
## Nishant Suria ##

My scene is a farmer stand, featuring fruits on a table and a showcase with fish on ice. In front of the stand, there is a robot ("Kyle") perusing the wares. Kyle is the main character in this scene, and the 'first person' camera is in its eyes. The skybox shows daybreak. I used objects that one would find in a farmer's market, with several kinds of fresh produce.
